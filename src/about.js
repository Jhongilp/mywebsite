      Currently I am making a career change from Foreign Trade major while working as export advisor 
      and studying Informatics Engineering. Despite the duties and responsibilities of these activities, 
      I have managed to study and learn to reinforce my expertise in programming. 
      I am looking forward to doing programming full time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though I have no programming job experience, I have solid knowledge programming and 8 years 
      of working experience in Foreign Trade that have cultivated abilities of team work, 
      communication and understanding customerâ€™s need.
